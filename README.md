I've ripped hundreds of CD's with abcde and before I embark on the next few hundred, I want to fix some bugs and have a go at some enhancements.

Testing platform: Ubuntu 22.04.4 x64 with two SATA CDROMs

My ripping objective is to create lossless music tracks (flac) for listening and also to record as much information from the read process as possible for archival posterity, such as cue sheet, CD-TEXT, enhanced CD directory listing, media read progress/status/errors and metadata downloaded.
